# HRSystem

A full stack web application using Angular at the front end, Node (Vanilla Js) at the back end, and MongoDB to store the data.
I used JWT for authentication.

The project is simply an HR system to manage the employees. it gives you the ability to add, delete, update, or filter the data of the employees. only the HR employees can log in to the system.

To be able to log into the system you need another HR employee to create an email for you and assign the group to HR.

I deployed the application so that you can see it in action here:

you can use 'hr@hr.com' to login to the system.
